# User Directory (React App)
  ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
  ## Description
As a user
I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once
so that I have quick access to their information.

This project is a simple user directory, built as a React App. It was bootstrapped using create-react-app.

  ## Installation
  Use the deployed app here: <br>
  [User Directory on GitHub Pages](https://kvaden19.github.io/react-user-directory/)
  <br><br>

  ## Usage
  When you visit the app, you will see a random selection of 10 users from the Random User API. These fictional users demonstrate the app's functionality. 

  To sort by users' home country, click the "Sort by Country" button on the top left. The users will be sorted by Country in alphabetical (A-Z) order. Clicking again will cause the users to be sorted in descending alphabetical order (Z-A).

  To filter by users' home country, click into the Filter box in the center left. Type in the name of a country and hit 'enter'. The list of users will be filtered to show only users in that country, if any. Currently the filter works on exact match only. Leaving the Filter empty and hitting enter will return to the full list of users.
